# VI. Linking Code

## 1. Explanation of the Linking Code Step

In bare-metal programming with RISC-V and Rust, the linking step involves integrating various compiled units and libraries into a single executable file. This process is crucial not only for the correct operation of the program but also involves optimization of execution efficiency and resource use. Below is a detailed explanation of this step.

#### The Role and Configuration of the Linker

1. **Basic Responsibilities of the Linker**:

   - The linker is responsible for resolving external symbol references, determining symbol addresses, and merging the compiled object files (.o files) and library files (.a files) into a single executable file.
   - For bare-metal programming, the linker must also place code, data, stack, and other segments according to a specific memory layout.

2. **Using a Specific Linker**:

   - Rust typically uses `lld` (LLVM's linker) as its default linker, supporting multiple architectures including RISC-V. You can specify the use of `lld` in `.cargo/config.toml`, for example:

     ```toml
     [target.riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf]
     rustflags = [
       "-C", "linker=rust-lld"
     ]
     ```

#### Custom Linker Scripts

Linker scripts are critical files in the linking process, defining the program's memory layout. In bare-metal projects, you need to precisely control the position of different segments to ensure they do not conflict with each other and meet hardware requirements.

1. **Writing Linker Scripts**:

   - Linker scripts typically have a file extension of `.ld` or `.lds`. In this file, you specify the sizes and positions of various segments such as `.text`, `.data`, `.bss`, and stack.

   - For example, a basic linker script might look like this:

     ```ld
     SECTIONS
     {
       . = 0x80000000;
       .text : { *(.text*) }
       . = ALIGN(4);
       .data : { *(.data*) }
       .bss : { *(.bss*) }
       . = ALIGN(8);
       stack_top = .;
       .stack : {
         . = . + 0x1000;
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Configuring Cargo to Use the Linker Script**:

   - Configure the compiler to use your linker script in `Cargo.toml` or `.cargo/config.toml`:

     ```toml
     [target.'cfg(target_arch = "riscv64")']
     rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-Tlink.ld"]
     ```

#### Linking Optimization and Verification

Optimization and verification after linking are also indispensable parts of the linking step, especially in a resource-constrained bare-metal environment.

1. **Optimizing Memory Usage**:
   - By adjusting the layout of segments in the linker script, you can minimize the use of RAM and ROM, for example, by removing unused segments or symbols.
   - Use tools like `nm` and `size` to analyze the size and symbol layout of the generated executable, identifying further optimization opportunities.

2. **Verifying the Final Binary File**:
   - Use tools such as `objdump` or `readelf` to view the final generated binary file, ensuring all symbols and segments are correctly placed.
   - Run test programs on simulators or actual hardware to verify the functionality and performance of the program meet expectations.

Through these steps, you can ensure that Rust bare-metal programs under the RISC-V architecture are correctly linked, producing executable files that meet hardware requirements. The correct linking process is not only related to whether the program can run but also directly affects the program's efficiency and reliability.

## 2. Unique Linking Steps and Technical Details

In the process of bare-metal programming with RISC-V and Rust, although the "Linking Code" step has been partly discussed during the project creation stage (such as setting and configuring linker scripts), many details and techniques still require unique handling and in-depth exploration during the actual compilation and linking stages. These technical points include but are not limited to advanced optimization during the linking process, error handling, and specific linking techniques for particular scenarios.

#### 1. Advanced Linking Optimization

In the linking stage, advanced optimization mainly involves the following aspects:

- **Space-saving optimization**: For example, using the `gc-sections` option to remove unused code and data segments. This is particularly important in bare-metal environments due to limited resources.

  ```toml
  [target.'cfg(target_arch = "riscv64")']
  rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-Wl,--gc-sections"]
  ```

- **Symbol Optimization**: Removing debug information through the `strip` command or linker options to reduce the final binary file size.

#### 2. Linking Error Handling

Linking

 errors are typically caused by symbol conflicts, missing symbols, or incorrect memory layout configurations. Handling these issues usually requires:

- **Detailed Error Logs**: Use the linker's verbose output option to get more information about which symbols or segments are problematic.

  ```bash
  cargo rustc --release -- -C link-args=-Wl,--verbose
  ```

- **Analysis Tools**: Utilize tools like `nm` and `readelf` to analyze target files and executables, checking symbol tables and segment information.

#### 3. Linking Configurations for Specific Scenarios

In certain specific application scenarios, linking configurations may need to be adjusted based on hardware features or application requirements:

- **Bare-Metal Multitasking**: When implementing a multitasking bare-metal system, it may be necessary to configure the memory positions of different tasks' code and data segments to ensure they do not interfere with each other and are managed correctly.

- **Firmware Upgrades**: In the design of firmware upgrade features, it may be necessary to divide the program into multiple parts that can be upgraded independently, each with its own linker script to control versions and memory layout.

#### 4. In-depth Customization of Linker Scripts

The importance of linker scripts in bare-metal programming cannot be overlooked. In some advanced use cases, the complexity of linker scripts far exceeds the beginner level, for example:

- **Advanced Memory Layout Control**: When designing systems that support complex peripherals, specific code or data may need to be located at specific memory addresses to meet the mapping requirements of peripherals.

- **Customization of Interrupt Vector Tables**: In RISC-V systems, it may be necessary to manually configure the position and content of the interrupt vector table, typically done through linker scripts.

### Practical Tips

1. **Debugging the Linking Process**: When encountering linking issues, increasing the output level of the linker or using graphical tools to visualize the memory layout are effective debugging methods.

2. **Automated Testing**: Automated testing of the linking process can ensure that new linking errors are not introduced during code iterations, especially in collaborative projects.

Through the above discussion, we can see that although the basic parts of linking code were set during project creation, many advanced and specific technical details still require in-depth handling during the actual compilation and linking stages. Properly managing these details is crucial for ensuring the performance and reliability of bare-metal programs.
